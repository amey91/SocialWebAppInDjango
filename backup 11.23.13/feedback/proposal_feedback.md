#### Proposal Feedback from Charlie Garrod

"Overall your project idea is good, and will provide an excellent opportunity for you to sucessfully demonstrate the fundamental web application engineering ideas of the course.

Your project seems to be an appropriate size for a two-person project.  (We are aware that Tim has left your team.)  You should be sure that, as you implement your project, that you include substantial features that are not closely related to the Grumblr; in many ways the core features of your site seem to be Grumblr + groups + group-based ratings, which is a very simple addition to the Grumblr data model.  

If you want to add complexity or sophistication to your site, you might brainstorm for ways in which you can integrate your site with external sources of data?  Stock-market-related data sources are sometimes costly or very limited in their (free) use, but you still might think of interesting ways that sources of external data could enrich user interactions on your site.

Looking forward to the next phases of your project,

#### Proposal Feedback from Ram

I like the idea of the proposal. You will have to keep multiple features for each group as you have identified (forums, events, polls etc). I like the idea of applying votes and getting points out of it. I would suggest you to display all members in leader board but of course if you want to highlight top 5, yes makes sense. In my opinion this application has right scope and opportunity to implement the features outlined. Coming to the core of the application, how will you manage investing decisions is it for investing in particular stock or any other business too. If it is stock may be you can integrate stock and its information in a post along with user recommendations. You can use Yahoo finance API to get the data. Good idea, make sure to implement all identified features and plan accordingly to match with scrum.

#### Proposal Feedback from Sairam

This sounds like a really interesting website! The project definitely seems a bit complex for a two-person group; in fact, you might want to scale it down a little and separate the optional from the essential features, so as to better manage your limited time. I would definitely find some way to get the reputation system and leader boards in there; to start off with, you could just allow users to upvote or down vote other members of the group (the mechanism behind this would be an extension of the dislikes feature in your Grumblr homework). Your app seems backend-heavy, so try to focus more on that rather than on the front-end.
