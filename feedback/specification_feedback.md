Project Specification Feedback
============

Good job! The specification is fairly comprehensive for the application. There are a number of pages though that seem to not be represented in the mockups. Most importantly, the invitation system seems to not be represented in some way. Once a member is invited to a group (or the request is accepted), then what happens? Does the user receive a notification somehow? Is there a page with pending and current memberships? There are also a few missing actions and mockups for groups, such as group membership management. How does a group admin manage the group? What does that page look like? What can they do? For example, presumably an admin has the power to accept membership requests and promote normal group members into admin members. This also means access controls for the group, so this group admin page is only accessible by group admins. These kinds of considerations will be important for Sprint 1. For Sprint 1, the backlog seems reasonable if a bit unambitious. I'd suggest adding the rest of the user and group related features such as users requesting memberships to groups and invitations for users to groups. Also, make sure to designate a person to be the product owner for Sprint 1.
